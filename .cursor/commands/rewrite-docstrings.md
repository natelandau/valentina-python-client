# Rewrite Docstrings

## Overview

Rewrite the docstrings for the current code to improve their quality, usefulness, and readability.

## Steps

1. **Review each function, class, or method**

    - Understand the purpose and functionality of the code
    - Identify the key inputs, outputs, and side effects
    - Review the code to understand the logic and implementation

2. **Rewrite the docstring**
    - Write a new docstring that is complete and accurate
    - Always use Google format docstrings
    - Always include Types in parentheses with arguments
    - Do not document return when nothing is returned
    - Only write in imperative voice. No Exceptions!
    - Never say "This function ..." Only use imperative voice.
    - Docstrings should always be descriptive and explain why a developer would use the function, not just what it does
    - Improve the clarity and conciseness of the docstring
    - Do not included raised exceptions unless they are explicitly raised in the code
    - Do not use line wraps and newlines within paragraphs.
    - Do not included raised exceptions unless they are explicitly raised in the code
