# Generate possible git commit messages

## Overview

Generate possible git commit messages based on the changes made to the codebase.

## Steps

1. **Prepare branch**
    - Review all staged changes made to the codebase
2. **Generate commit messages**
    - Provide a clear, concise summary of what this PR accomplishes
    - Generate possible git commit messages based on the summary
3. **Review commit messages**
    - Review the list of possible git commit messages
    - Select the best 3 to 5 commit messages for the changes made to the codebase
    - Provide the commit messages to the user

## Commit Message Rules

-   When you finish applying changes, the last line of the message should be "Don't forget to commit!" and give me a commit command as well.
-   Always use angular style conventional commits style. No Exceptions!
-   The first line of the commit should never be more than 50 characters
-   Each commit message consists of a header, and a body. The header has a special format that includes a type, a scope and a subject: `(<scope>): <subject>`
-   The types must be one of the following:
    -   build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
    -   ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
    -   docs: Documentation only changes
    -   feat: A new feature
    -   fix: A bug fix
    -   perf: A code change that improves performance
    -   refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
    -   style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
    -   test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
-   The scope should be the name of the package, feature, codebase, or area that is effected
-   The subject contains a succinct description of the change:
    -   use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes" in the subject
    -   don't capitalize the first letter of the subject
    -   no dot (.) at the end of the subject
-   In the body, just as in the summary, use the imperative, present tense: "fix" not "fixed" nor "fixes".
-   The body will explain the motivation for the change in the commit message body. This commit message should explain WHY you are making the change. You can include a comparison of the previous behavior with the new behavior in order to illustrate the impact of the change.
