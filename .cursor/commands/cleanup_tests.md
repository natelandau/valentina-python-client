# Cleanup Tests

## Overview

Cleanup the tests to improve their quality and readability.

## Steps

1. **Review each test**
    - Understand the purpose and functionality of the test
    - Identify the key inputs, outputs, and side effects
    - Review the test to understand the logic and implementation
2. **Cleanup each test**
    - Write single sentence docstrings in imperative voice starting with the word "Verify"
    - Reorganized tests to follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
    - Use given/when/then comments to structure the test body
    - Do not change the actual code itself, only the docstrings, comments, and formatting
