## Python class style

- MUST keep classes focused on a single responsibility
- MUST keep __init__ simple; avoid complex logic
- Use dataclasses for simple data containers
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Avoid creating additional class functions if they are not necessary
- Use @property for computed attributes
