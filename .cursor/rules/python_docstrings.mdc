## Python docstring standards

Always follow these rules when writing Python docstrings

- MUST include docstrings for all public functions, classes, and methods
- MUST document function parameters, return values, and exceptions raised
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
- Include examples in docstrings for complex functions
- Read and understand the entire function or class before writing the docstring
- Always use Google format docstrings
- Do not document return when nothing is returned
- Only write in imperative voice. No Exceptions!
- Never say "This function ..." Only use imperative voice.
- Docstrings should always be descriptive and explain why a developer would use the function, not just what it does
- Do not use line wraps and newlines within paragraphs.
- Do not included raised exceptions unless they are explicitly raised in the code

### Examples of good python docstrings

```python
def read_config(path: Path = "config.toml", globs:list[str] | None = None) -> list[Path]:
    """Read and validate the TOML configuration file that maps repository names to paths.

    Search the given `path` for files matching any of the glob patterns provided in `globs`. If no globs are provided, returns all files in the directory.

    Args:
        path (Path): The root directory where the search will be conducted.
        globs (list[str] | None, optional): A list of glob patterns to match files (e.g., "*.txt", "*.py"). If None, returns all files. Defaults to None.

    Returns:
        list[Path]: A list of Path objects representing the files that match the glob patterns.

    Raises:
        cappa.Exit: If the config file doesn't exist, contains invalid TOML, or has invalid repository paths
    """
    ...
```
