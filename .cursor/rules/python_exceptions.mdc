## Python exceptions standards

- NEVER silently swallow exceptions without logging
- MUST never use bare except: clauses
- MUST catch specific exceptions rather than broad exception types
- MUST use context managers (with statements) for resource cleanup
- Provide meaningful error messages
- **Use `try-except` blocks:** Wrap code that may raise exceptions in `try-except` blocks.
- **Handle specific exceptions:** Catch specific exception types instead of using a generic `except Exception`.
- add messages to a variable before adding it to the exception
