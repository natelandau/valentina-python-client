# Run Linting After Python Changes

After making changes to Python files, always run the lint command to verify the changes pass all checks:

```bash
uv run duty lint
```

This command runs the full linting suite including:
- Pre-commit hooks
- Ruff check and format
- Type checking (ty)
- Other code quality checks

Wait for the command to complete and fix any errors before considering the task done.
