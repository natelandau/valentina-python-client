"""Default client registry and service factory functions.

This module provides a way to access services from any module without passing
the client explicitly. VClient automatically registers itself as the default
when instantiated (unless `set_as_default=False` is passed).

Example:
    ```python
    from vclient import VClient, companies_service

    # Client auto-registers as default
    client = VClient(api_key="...")

    # Use services anywhere
    async def some_function():
        companies = companies_service()
