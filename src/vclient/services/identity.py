    """Service for resolving verified provider logins to canonical users.

    Forward the credential obtained from a provider's own login flow (an OIDC
    ID token for apple/google, an OAuth access token for discord/github). The
    API verifies the credential with the provider and resolves the user in
    order: match by provider ID, auto-link by provider-verified email, or
    create a new UNAPPROVED user.

    This service does not require an acting user (no On-Behalf-Of header).
    Authentication is via developer API key only.

    Example:
        >>> async with VClient() as client:
        ...     identity = client.identity()
        ...     result = await identity.identify(provider="google", token="<id-token>")
